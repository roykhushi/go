Compiled lang -> go tool can run file directly w/o a vm
used in system app, cloud infra
doesnt use classes but uses struct
no concept of overloading/overriding
no try and catch
lexer does most of the work


5 reasons of why go?
-> build time : imp for auto scaling proj due to less build times as code compiles to machine code and is v fast  
-> fast startup :  
-> perf and efficiency
-> concurrency model
-> static typing and compilation
